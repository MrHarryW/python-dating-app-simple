# 📘 **1. Overview**

Harry’s Dating App is a multi-file Python project designed to collect user information, create a unique dating profile, and suggest potential partners based on preferences.
The project includes:

* A realistic loading animation
* Full account system (login + account creation)
* Secure input validation
* Long-form profile creation
* User data saved permanently in a JSON file
* Simple matching algorithm
* Clean, modular codebase

The goal was to extend a basic GCSE task into a more professional, realistic application.

# **2. Key Features**

## ✔ **Login & Account Creation**

* Users can create their own username and password.
* Returning users can log in with their saved credentials.
* Usernames cannot be duplicated.
* Passwords require a minimum length for safety.

## ✔ **Persistent Data Storage**

* All profiles and login details are stored permanently in `user_data.json`.
* The app loads and updates this file automatically.

## ✔ **Modular Python Code (Multi-file Project)**

The program is split into several files:

```
main.py          - Main program & flow control
ui.py            - Displays loading screen & interface
validation.py    - Age, password, and numeric validation
profiles.py      - All profile creation questions
database.py      - Saves and loads user data (JSON)
logic.py         - Matching system & partner suggestions
user_data.json   - Stores accounts and profiles
```

This structure demonstrates professional coding practices and improves readability and maintainability.

## ✔ **Profile Creation System**

Users provide:

* Basic personal details
* Holiday destinations
* Favourite activities
* Five essential things
* Dating preferences
* Preferred age range
* First date location

All information is stored and can be retrieved later.

## ✔ **Matching Algorithm**

Based on gender preference, the app:

* Shows available candidates
* Lets the user choose a match
* Displays the selected partner’s details
* Suggests a random “ideal date day”

## ✔ **Loading Animation**

A long, realistic loading sequence simulates how a real application would initialise services.
This includes steps such as:

* Locating servers
* Reading profile data
* Loading onboarding services
* Creating UI/UX

The animation is cleaner but still shows each individual step for realism.

# **3. How the Program Works**

### 1. **Loading Screen**

A series of animated messages simulate startup processes.

### 2. **Age Verification**

Users must be 18 or older.
Invalid ages repeat the prompt.

### 3. **Account Selection**

* New users create a username and password.
* Existing users enter their credentials and are logged in if correct.

### 4. **Profile Creation**

New users answer questions to build their profile.
Returning users may skip this step (depending on teacher requirements).

### 5. **Data Storage**

Profile data is added to `user_data.json` through Python’s `json` module.

### 6. **Matching**

The app displays a list of potential partners based on selected gender.
The user chooses one, and the app displays their information.

### 7. **Completion**

The program ends with a friendly thank-you message and suggested date day.

# **4. Technologies Used**

* **Python 3**
* **JSON** for permanent data storage
* Built-in Python modules:

  * `json`
  * `random`
  * `time`

No external libraries required.

# **5. File Structure Explained**

```
dating_app/
│
├── main.py              # Controls the app flow (login → profile → matching)
├── ui.py                # Loading screen display
├── validation.py        # Input and password checks
├── profiles.py          # Profile creation question logic
├── database.py          # Save/load users to JSON
├── logic.py             # Partner matching functions
└── user_data.json       # Stores user accounts + profiles
```

This structure makes the program:

* Easier to debug
* Easier to read
* More professional
* Suitable for extension

---

# **6. Design Decisions**

Several improvements were made beyond the basic GCSE requirements:

### ✔ Multi-file architecture

Shows good coding practice.

### ✔ JSON storage

Allows permanent data saving without databases—GCSE appropriate but impressive.

### ✔ Cleaner loops and functions

Avoids repetitive code and encourages modular thinking.

### ✔ Improved UX

The loading sequence is more polished and realistic.

### ✔ Scalability

Multiple users can create accounts and be stored without overwriting each other.

# **7. Testing**

The application was tested for:

* Age under 18 → reject
* Passwords under 8 characters → reject
* Duplicate username creation → reject
* Wrong login password → reject
* JSON file updates correctly
* Lists accept correct number of items
* Matching system displays correct candidates
* Inputs that could break the program (non-number values)

---

# **8. Future Improvements (Optional)**

Possible enhancements include:

* Password hashing for security
* GUI version using Tkinter
* Edit profile feature
* Delete account feature
* Interest-based matching algorithm
* Colourful UI using `colorama`
